Recently, the online culture has become established due to the influence of Corona 19, 
and the usage time of online devices has increased. If you focus on the screen for a long 
time, such as laptops and smartphones, the blink rate will decrease more than usual, which 
will worsen eye health such as dry eye syndrome. To prevent eye health from getting worse, 
we have developed a device to help people to follow the instructions like closing their 
eyes for a few seconds and exercising their eyes. 
Our device checks blink rate using EOG (electrooculogram) signal and determine whether 
instructions are necessary. The device also uses a stopwatch function and event that pass 
data between forms for checking people have followed the directions.
